# TeaStrainer
This program uses a recursive algorithm and little bit of maths to create a visual representation of a recursive algorithm, aka Seirpinski type pattern. I have called it Tea Strainer due to the "sieve" type pattern it produces.

If you want to run it, compile the files appropriately (I use DrJava or command line). Afterwards run TeaStrainer.java and it will prompt you for input.
